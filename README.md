Installing
----------
Copy and paste the following into your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/montauk/Adium-Solarized.git && cd Adium-Solarized && ./build.sh
```

Double-click `Solarized.adiumstatusicons` to install the status icons,
`Solarized.ListLayout` to install the contact list layout, and
`Solarized.ListTheme` to install the const list theme (Solarized Light).

For a solarized message style I recommend
[ezanol's theme](https://github.com/ezanol/Adium-Solarized).
